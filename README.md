# Iris-Dataset-Basic-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python:
Load and clean the weather dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
Perform basic EDA to generate summary statistics and visualize correlations using a heatmap.
Utilize linear regression to predict average temperature based on wind speed, and evaluate the model's performance.
Visualize the actual vs predicted temperatures with scatter plots.
Data Visualization with Power BI or Tableau:
Create comprehensive visualizations in Power BI or Tableau to represent patterns observed during the EDA.
Explore and highlight correlations, patterns, and trends within the weather dataset through interactive and insightful visual representations.
